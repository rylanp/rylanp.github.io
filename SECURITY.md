# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

Um, I guess just the current version is not broken (:

| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| current | :white_check_mark: |
| earlier | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Well. Hmmm. Hopefully you can like add a comment on this repository and I might see it sometime.

I really jsut use this website to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JS.
Plus, it's a lot of fun.
