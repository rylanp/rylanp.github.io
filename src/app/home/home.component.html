It utilizes Firebase Firestore for the backend, which allows users to create their own courses in the app and see nearby courses. With over 2,500+ downloads, there are over 300+ user added courses. The simple interface makes using the app mid-round a breeze. Additionally, a user can create a group with their friends to compare scores during a round with a live leaderboard. Developed in XCode with Swift, I learned the ins and outs of mobile app development."

I joined the communications team for Irishsat the fall of my freshman year where I started working on some digital signal processing algorithms. As I led the team, we were able to pair our digital signal processing programs (C and Python) with an Ettus B210 USRP and an Epiq SidekiqZ2 to send BPSK modulated data from the Sidekiq to the USRP. On receive, the data is corrected and demodulated relatively sucessfully. It is not a perfect system, but it is getting closer as we continuously work to improve the DSP for a 2U Cubesat application. I've learned a tremendous amount from my experiences thus far including digital signal processing (DSP), Linux, SSH, SCP, Linux services, C, makefiles, compilation, toolchains, spectrum analyzers, antenna radiation patterns, git, ..."

This changed with Galactic Warfare. This is my first and only more polished game that I have released to the community on Itch.io. All of the beautiful pixel art graphics were handmade myself, aside from the asteroids. The game is a simple multiplayer game where the player is launched into the middle of a free-for-all style battle of ships in space. The player must fly around shooting lasers, dropping bombs, and trapping enemies in vortexes. As per common knowledge, there are lightning storms in space just like in the skies of Earth (lol)! This lightning can take out the power of any ship and reduce it to a floating piece of metal. The player must collect crystals to upgrade their fire rate and destroy enemy ships to level up their ship. Additionally, you can connect up to 4 xbox controllers to play a local multiplayer with your friends."
